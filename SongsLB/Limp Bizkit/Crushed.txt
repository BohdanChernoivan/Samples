It's Limp Bizkit! And this is how we learn.

You can't talk to me.
You're not supposed to be in my face. (So get the fuck outa my face!)
But you insist, you gotta talk that shit.
You gotta keep that dog ass breath all up in my face.
But remember when you would never lie to a friend
'Cause you were so high
You were so shy
You were so fucked up anyway.

Life keeps on tickin', 
Tickin, tickin' into the future.
'Cause this is how we learn.
Somebody better stop me
Or at least stop this beat
Before we start gettin out of hand.
'Cause this is how we learn
And this how we burn.
Somebody better stop me
Or at least stop this beat
Before we start gettin out of hand.
'Cause this is how we learn
And this how we burn.

You can't erase me.
I'm alive as I can be
In your face. (So get the fuck outa my face!)
But you insist, it's gotta turn out like this.
It's gonna burn out like this all up in my face.
But I remember how
You said you want it all and you want it now
Cause you were so young
You were so dumb
You were so fucked up anyway.

Life keeps on tickin', 
Tickin, tickin' into the future.
'Cause this is how we learn
Somebody better stop me
Or at least stop this beat
Before we start gettin out of hand.
'Cause this is how we learn
And this how we burn.
Somebody better stop
or at least stop this beat
Before we start gettin out of hand.
'Cause this is how we learn
And this how we burn.

Think about it . . . think about it . . . 
Where you at? Come on.
I know your feelin it baby
I know your feelin it . . . 
Come on freak baby
Freak freak baby
Freak baby
Freak freak baby
And this is how it should be done
And this is how it should be done
Cause my style is identical to none
I'm outa here, I'm gettin the hell outa here
Limp Bizkit style. Hey Leatha wait up.
